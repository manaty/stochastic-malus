# stochastic-malus
 A physics-based simulation exploring whether chaotic interactions of falling rods through polarizers can reproduce the statistical behavior predicted by Malus' Law, investigating the classical analogue to quantum polarization effects.

[simulation1.py](simulation1.py) initial experiment when you can see the physics

[simulation2.py](simulation2.py) use simulation time, track pass rate

[simulation3.py](simulation3.py) auto adjust spaing bars to get 50% pass rate +-1%
